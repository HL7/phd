This example comes from a pulse oximeter when the sensor mechanism is having a set of difficulties. The set of difficulties are reported by setting a bit respresenting the issue in an integer. Since HL7 does not support this kind of measurement, the bit settings are converted to codes for FHIR using the ASN1ToHL7 code system. In this case the codes have value 150604.x where x is the Mder bit representing a given condition and '150604' is the MDC code describing the measurement. '150604' is a device and sensor status measurement. In this case, 5 of the 16 possible flags are set. All of the bits in this measurement are events thus they are only *required* to be reported when set (values are "Y" in FHIR).

Note there is no logical id in this resource as this resource is being uploaded to the server in a create operation. The server will create the logical id and return it to the sender in the response. There is also no reference to the coincident time stamp since this observation is generated by a device that is streaming data and reporting no time stamp. The time stamp is taken to be the time of reception by the gateway.
