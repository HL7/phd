A consumer of the PHD profile resources will find most of the mapping is as expected if they are familiar with the Patient, Device, and Observation resources. Though the spectrum of PHDs is extensive, the generic modeling approach results in a similar set of elements being used in all cases, simplifying the reading task for the consumer. For example, the following elements are all that is needed to obtain the information for most measurements:


|Resource|element|Meaning|
|-
|Observation|.code|Tells what the measurement is|
|Observation|.effectiveDateTime|Tells when the measurement was taken|
||.effectivePeriod||
|Observation|.valueQuantity.value|Gives the value of the measurement if a number|
||.valueCodeableConcept|Gives the value of the measurement if a code|
||.valueSampledData|Gives the values when the measurements are a periodic sequence|
||*value absent with* dataAbsentReason|value has an error|
||*value absent with* no dataAbsentReason|indicates the measurement is a vector or set of binary (set/cleared) events or states and is found in component elements|
|Observation|.interpretation.value|Gives some special conditions about the overall measurement that are not 'complete' errors such as 'questionable'. Infrequent.|
|Observation|.component.code|Tells what the individual vector sub-value is or event/state is|
||.component.valueQuantity|gives the sub value when the measurement is a vector|
||component.valueCodeableConcept|gives whether the event or state is set or cleared|
||*sub-value absent*|a dataAbsentReason is present indicating the sub value is in error or the event/state is unsupported|
||component.interpretation|Gives some special conditions about the measurement sub-value that are not 'complete' errors such as 'questionable'. Infrequent.|
