The scope of this guide is limited to the modeling, mapping and usage of observations, primarily consisting of physiological measurements, and device data from *communicating* PHDs. Furthermore, these PHDs must communicate a sufficient amount of information in a manner that guarantees the generation of reliable measurement time stamps.

It is anticipated that this guide will be used in any scenario where observations generated by PHDs are needed. For example, a Patient Care profile that requires a patient take one or more measurements using appropriate PHDs and upload those measurements. The Patient Care profile could specify the use of this IG to perform the uploads. The Patient Care profile would then know what FHIR resources to read and how to extract the information of interest from those resources.

This Implementation Guide may be referenced by profiles from the IHE Devices domain or the IHE Patient Care Coordination domain. This guide is concerned with the FHIR data model and specifies how one maps PHD information into FHIR resources and defines FHIR profiles of the FHIR resources involved. This mapping will typically be implemented in a PHG that uploads the PHD information to a FHIR Server.
