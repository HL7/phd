This Implementation Guide is meant for developers of both PHD data uploaders and of readers of FHIR resources that process observation data provided by PHDs. Specifically, the implementers of Continua-certified Personal Health Gateways (PHGs) can use this Implementation Guide to encode PHD information into FHIR resources that can be stored on FHIR servers for further processing or analysis. 95% of this guide is dedicated to the uploader which has to work with the complexities of IEEE 11073 PHDs. Consumers needing PHD information will use this guide to ascertain what resources to access and what elements in those resources have the desired information. Ultimately, the Implementation Guide will help personal health device manufacturers and service providers to map observations and device data into a FHIR-based information system.

This guide will be of use to anyone who wishes to work with IEEE 11073 PHD data in FHIR format.
