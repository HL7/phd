# Referenced Organizations and Their Relevance

This Implementation Guide (IG) references several organizations that play important roles in the development, standardization, and implementation of Personal Health Device (PHD) interoperability. Below is a summary of each organization, its relevance to this IG, and a link to its homepage.

## [HL7 International](https://www.hl7.org/)
**Relevance:** HL7 is the standards development organization responsible for the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. This IG is built on FHIR and follows HL7 methodologies for profiling and implementation guidance.

## [IEEE 11073 Standards Committee](https://sagroups.ieee.org/11073/)
**Relevance:** The IEEE 11073 Standards Committee develops the 11073 family of standards for medical device communication, including:
- **IEEE 11073-10206:** Defines the Abstract Content Model (ACOM) for personal health devices, which is the primary data model mapped in this IG.
- **IEEE 11073-20601:** An earlier standard for PHDs, referenced for historical context and compatibility.

## [Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group)](https://www.bluetooth.com/)
**Relevance:** The Bluetooth SIG defines wireless communication protocols, including the Generic Health Sensor Profile and Service, which are based on IEEE 11073-10206. These protocols are widely used for PHD communication and are supported by this IG.

## [IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise)](https://www.ihe.net/)
**Relevance:** IHE develops integration profiles for healthcare IT systems. This IG may be referenced by IHE Devices and Patient Care Coordination domain profiles to ensure consistent use of PHD data in broader healthcare workflows.

## [PCHAlliance (Personal Connected Health Alliance)](https://www.pchalliance.org/)
**Relevance:** PCHAlliance managed the Continua Design Guidelines, which provided certification for interoperable PHDs based on IEEE 11073-20601. While the certification program is no longer active, the guidelines influenced the development of this IG.
