The Numeric Observation Profile is used when the PHD metric measurement is a scalar that may be dimensionless. Examples would be weight, body temperature, glucose concentration, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, steps take, calories burned, etc. Scalar measurements are the most common type of PHD measurement. 

The measurement is a scalar when the PHD metric contains one of the following attributes:

<style>table, th, td {
border: 1px solid black;
border-collapse:collapse;
padding: 6px;}</style>

|Attribute|Value|Additional Information|
|-
|Basic-Nu-Observed-Value|16-bit Mder SFLOAT|12-bit mantissa|
|Simple-Nu-Observed-Value|32-bit Mder FLOAT|24-bit mantissa|
|Nu-Observed-Value|32-bit Mder FLOAT|Complex attribute. Also contains<br/> metric-id<br/> measurement status<br/> unit-code|

These attributes contain a measurement value that is a single number. The Mder SFLOAT and FLOAT encodings indicate both precision and the number of significant figures. The Observation.valueQuantity.value element is required to honor the reported precision. See the section [Mder FLOATs and SFLOATs](MderFLOATsandSFLOATs.html) for instructions on handling Mder S/FLOATs and their encoding to the valueQuantity .

The structure definition for this profile is given [here](StructureDefinition-PhdNumericObservation.html)

### Mapping Numerics to FHIR
The following table shows how the numeric attributes are mapped to FHIR. Since the FHIR Quantity also contains the units the Unit-Code attribute value is required to complete the picture. The MDC unit code needs to be mapped to UCUM. In most cases this mapping is straight forward, but there can be some examples which are tricky. The MDC_DIM_TICK for the RR interval is just the number of ticks. However, the tick unit is given by the MDS attribute MDC_ATTR_TICK_RES which is the number of ticks per second. So if MDC_ATTR_TICK_RES is 2048 and the RR measurement is 3092, that means the RR interval is 1.5 seconds. One could also express the measurement in Hertz. When the units are converted in this manner, the value must be converted appropriately.

### Conditional Create Identifier Generation
For a general description of the PHD Observation Identifier see the "PHD Observation Identifier" section in [PHD Base Observation Profile](BaseObservationProfile.html). The table below lists the items that make up the identifier.

|Entry|value|Additional information|
|-
|device|"PhdDevice.identifier.value"|This value is the PHD IEEE EUI-64 system identifier|
|patient|"Patient.identifier.value-Patient.identifier.system" or<br/>provided logical id|The dashes are part of the identifier. <br/>When the service provider gives the PHG a pre-determined patient logical id the PHG creates no Patient resource and has no patient information. In that special case the provided logical id is used|
|type|"Observation.code.coding.code"|See [Obtaining the Observation Code](ObtainObservationCode.html)|
|value|"Observation.valueQuantity.value" or <br/> "Observation.dataAbsentReason.coding.code|The numerical value of the measurement or <br/> the data absent reason if the value is not present|
|units|"Observation.valueQuantity.code"|The UCUM code for the units|
|reported PHD timestamp|"timestamp"|See [Generating the PHD Reported Time Stamp](GeneratingtheReportedTimeStampIdentifier.html)|
|supplemental types|"Supplemental-Types.*N*-"|A sequence of 32-bit MDC codes separated by a dash|

The final identifier is made by concatenating the entries above as follows:
 - "device-patient-type-value-units-reported PHD timestamp-supplemental types"

### Additional Numerical Measurement Information
IEEE 11073-20601 numeric metric measurements have some additional optional attributes that are used only for numerics. When they occur, these additional attributes provide further information about the measurement. An example of such a numeric-only additional attribute is one that describes the accuracy of the measurement. The accuracy is a measure of the deviation of the actual measurement from the reported measurement. Consequently, 'accuracy' is not a concept that makes any sense in the context of a measurement which is one or more of a finite set of enumerated codes such as a glucose-monitor meal association (breakfast, snack, fasting, etc.), and thus the attribute is not used in Enumeration metrics.

As in the PhdBaseObservation profile, an Observation.component element is used to contain the additional information. There are five metric attributes that give extra information about numeric-only measurements.

#### Accuracy
The Accuracy attribute gives the maximum deviation as an absolute value of the reported measurement from the actual measurement *over the entire range of the measurement*. The reported accuracy is, thus, static and does not vary over the range of the measurement. It shall be reported if the PHD provides it and it is not corrupted. It is in the units of the measurement itself. The entries are as populated as follows:

|Observation.component element|entry|Additional Information|
|-
|code.coding.code|67914|This is the MDC code for the Accuracy attribute|
|code.coding.system|urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101|Indicates the MDC coding system|

|valueQuantity.system|http://unitsofmeasure.org |Indicates the UCUM coding system|
|valueQuantity.code|shall be the code of the primary measurement|The code shall be the UCUM unit code|

#### Alert Operational State
The Alert Operational State is currently only used in the Pulse Oximeter specialization. This attribute uses an ASN1-BITs field to indicate whether the alerts on a given limit (upper or lower) are on or off. When SET, the alerts are off. This is a state-type measurement and when this attribute is present, both the set and cleared states are reported. Three bits are defined thus there will be three component entries for each of the bits.

### Examples:

A basic simple numeric observation with a time stamp and a supplemental types attribute is shown in [Pulse Rate Spot Measurement](spotNumeric.html). Simple numeric measurements are common in PHDs.

An example of a NaN (not a number) measurement is shown in [NaN Example](NumericNaN.html). Note that the value element is absent and replaced by a dataAbsentReason element.

### Consumer of the PHD Numeric Observation Profile
The consumer of this profile does not need to concern itself with the mapping complexities or the PHD-related entry for the Observation.identifier which is used by the uploader to prevent data duplication. There are no extensions introduced by this profile except for the HL7 gateway extension so the resource is consumable by any reader that understands the Observation resource. The following table summarizes the elements used describing the measurement:
