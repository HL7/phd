This Guide has the following chapters:

Table of Contents
#### Overview
This [chapter](overview.html) describes the purpose of these guidelines, its scope, what it is meant to do as well as what it is not meant to do, who it is of interest for, and some use cases. 
#### Profile Consumers
This [chapter](ProfileConsumers.html) describes the content of the resources for those interested in consuming the data. A great deal of this guide is dedicated to the mapping of Personal Health Device (PHD) data to FHIR for those implementing Personal Health Gateways. The mapping requires considerable knowledge of the PHD communication protocols and the IEEE 11073-20601 Domain Information Model. That knowledge is not necessary for consumption of the generated resources. Readers interesting in consuming the data can skip the mapping details and begin here.
#### PHG Implementation Guidance
This informative [chapter](TechnicalImplementationGuidance.html) provides an introduction and overview of the IEEE 11073-20601 topics used in the profile mappings, such as the 20601 Domain Information Model (DIM), DIM objects and attributes, nomenclature codes, Mder FLOATs and SFLOATs, among others. This chapter also discusses some of the reasons behind the generic modeling approach used by this guide. 
#### Profiles
This [chapter](profiles.html) contains the normative content for PHG implementation. It provides the Structure Definitions for each of the eleven profiles as well as sections giving the mapping details. It is here where the PHG implementer needs to go to develop the software. For convenience, there are links back to sections in the PHG Implementation Guidance in the Profile Details sections when some of the trickier topics come up.
#### Artifact Index
This [chapter](artifacts.html) lists all the Structure Definitions, Code Systems, Value Sets, Capability Statements, and Examples relevant to this guide. It should be noted that the non-Bundle examples illustrate the resources once on the FHIR server. These examples will always have logical ids, but in many cases, the uploaded example should NOT have logical ids. The PHG implementer should use the examples in the normative profile sections describing the mapping for guidance instead of those in this chapter.
#### History
