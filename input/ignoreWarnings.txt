== Suppressed Messages ==

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem (And include comments like this justifying why)

# All example observation in this IG are suppossed to be device generated with often an unknown performer. There is text in the IG to explain this. The affected example observations / bundles are: bits-observation.json, bundle-continuousnonin.json, bundle-example-1.json, coin-20181119174911.json, coin-20181119202022.json, coin-example-1.json, coin-example-timefault.json, glucose-1.0.0.4.json, numeric-observation-not-a-number.json, numeric-spotnumeric.json, stringenum-1234.json
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# This is a recent code for a spirometer device type. Created a pull request on the codes in https://github.com/FHIR/packages/pulls
The code '528413' is not valid in the system urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101 (Unknown code '528413' in the CodeSystem 'urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101' version '2023-04-26')

# partition is a known IEEE 11073-10101 concept - discussion on Zulip how to fix this: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Why.20is.20the.20ISO.2FIEEE.2011073.20Codesystem.20seen.20as.20draft.3F/near/456526001
The property 'partition' is not known for the system 'urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101', so may not be understood by the terminology ecosystem. Known properties for this system: concept,code,status,inactive,effectiveDate,deprecationDate,retirementDate,notSelectable,synonym,comment,itemWeight

# These code systems are PHD specific
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# When a vital signs observation has a derivedFrom reference to a timestamp observation this is also checked against vital signs, leading to these warnings. 
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/bp|4.3.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/oxygensat|4.3.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/heartrate|4.3.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice Defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdCompoundNumericObservation|1.1.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# This warning is generated when new observation categoriy codes are defined and required in observation profiles, outside the preferred set of codes from the base FHIR spec: 
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Observation Category Codes' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-category|4.3.0), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/CodeSystem/PhdObservationCategories#phd-observation)

# This warning is generated for a coincident timestamp observation that is not a vital signs observation, but referenced in a derivedFrom element in another observation that is a vital sign. This will be fixed by using an extension instead in the next version of the IG. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46586.
