# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem (And include comments like this justifying why)

# Example observation in this IG are supposed to be device generated with often an unknown performer. There is text in the IG to explain this. The affected example observations / bundles are: bits-observation.json, bundle-continuousnonin.json, bundle-example-1.json, coin-20181119174911.json, coin-20181119202022.json, coin-example-1.json, coin-example-timefault.json, glucose-1.0.0.4.json, numeric-observation-not-a-number.json, numeric-spotnumeric.json, stringenum-1234.json
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# partition is a known IEEE 11073-10101 concept - discussion on Zulip how to fix this: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Why.20is.20the.20ISO.2FIEEE.2011073.20Codesystem.20seen.20as.20draft.3F/near/456526001
The property 'partition' is not known for the system 'urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101', so may not be understood by the terminology ecosystem. Known properties for this system: concept,code,status,inactive,effectiveDate,deprecationDate,retirementDate,notSelectable,synonym,comment,itemWeight

# These code systems are PHD specific
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# When a vital signs observation is also checked against the vital signs profile these warnings are generated. The vitals sign category element does not match the slice for the `phd` category. These are no real problems.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/bp|6.0.0-ballot3 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/oxygensat|6.0.0-ballot3 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/heartrate|6.0.0-ballot3 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/bodytemp|6.0.0-ballot3 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# When a Phd compound observation is also a vital sign this warning is generated. The LOINC coding does not match the slice for the MDC coding. This is not a real problem.
This element does not match any known slice Defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdCompoundNumericObservation|3.0.0-draft (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdCompoundObservation|3.0.0-draft (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# numeric slicing messages - can be ignored safely
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdNumericObservation|3.0.0-draft (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# This warning is generated when different categories are required in resources that comply with different profiles like vitals-signs and phd:
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Observation Category Codes' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-category|6.0.0-ballot3), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/CodeSystem/PhdObservationCategories#phd)
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Vital Signs Category' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-vitalsign-category|6.0.0-ballot3), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/CodeSystem/PhdObservationCategories#phd)

# Will be resolved after the ballot.
The type of property 'code' is 'code', but no ValueSet information was found, so the codes will be validated as internal codes

# This is generated for all observations that use the vital signs category. The vitals sign category element does not match the slice for the `phd` category. This warning can be ignored safely.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdNumericObservation|2.0.0-ballot2 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# This informational message is due to inheriting this extension from the core specification.
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.3.0-ballot-tc1 is deprecated with the note Use additionalBinding extension or element instead

# We will switch to the new Device Gateway extension in the next version of the PHD IG. 
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/observation-gatewayDevice|5.3.0-ballot-tc1 is deprecated with the note Use Device Gateway (device-gateway) extension which allows codeableReference (Device) in R6 and requires cross version extension for codeable reference.

# This warning is generated on purpose in two examples that use a private code on purpose. This warning can hence safely be ignored.
Constraint failed: mdc-1: 'A published MDC Code is preferred but private MDC codes are allowed as well.' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdBaseObservation)

# weird slicing message for each code system defined in this IG. Can be ignored safely.

# Publisher process choice - can safely be ignored
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed

# R6 packages not yet available - using R5 packages as interim solution

# Best practice recommendation for R6 - fixed[x] vs pattern[x]. Using (exactly) is intentional for strict matching.
