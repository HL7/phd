# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem (And include comments like this justifying why)

# This rule is too strict for device generated observations; all example observation in this IG are suppossed to be device generated with often an unknown performer. Added text in the IG to explain this.
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# This is a valid code for a spirometer device type. The IEEE 11073-10429 spirometer device specialization was published in 2022. Started a Zulip discussion to get this code added.
The code '528413' is not valid in the system urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101 (Unknown code '528413' in the CodeSystem 'urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101' version '2023-04-26')

# Partition is a known IEEE 11073-10101 concept - not sure how to fix this....
The property 'partition' is not known for the system 'urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101', so may not be understood by the terminology ecosystem. Known properties for this system: concept,code,status,inactive,effectiveDate,deprecationDate,retirementDate,notSelectable,synonym,comment,itemWeight

# The ISO/IEEE 11073 Codesystem is not draft - started a Zulip discussion to fix that.

# The PHD Base Observation is never instantiated directly on its own - it provides a basis for specific Observation profiles
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdBaseObservation'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

# When this happens, we'll handle it with THO... however ignores does not really work...
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# The slicing checks on this blood pressure example are too strict: in addition to meeting the FHIR bp profile it has an additional category element and an additional mean bp component and no other optional components as defined in the PhdBaseObservation.
This element does not match any known slice Defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/bp|4.3.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice Defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdCompoundNumericObservation|1.1.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# The slicing checks on this heart rate example are too strict: in addition to meeting the FHIR bp profile it has an additional category element.
This element does not match any known slice Defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/heartrate|4.3.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# The slicing checks on this oxygen saturation example are too strict: in addition to meeting the FHIR bp profile it has an additional category element.
This element does not match any known slice Defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/oxygensat|4.3.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# The check on category code is too strict when multiple categories are used.
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Observation Category Codes' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-category|4.3.0), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/CodeSystem/PhdObservationCategories#phd-observation)
