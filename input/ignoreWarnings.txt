== Suppressed Messages ==

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem (And include comments like this justifying why)

# This best practice rule is too strong for device generated observations; all example observation in this IG are suppossed to be device generated with often an unknown performer. There is text in the IG to explain this.
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# This is a recent code for a spirometer device type. Created a pull request on the codes in https://github.com/FHIR/packages/pulls
The code '528413' is not valid in the system urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101 (Unknown code '528413' in the CodeSystem 'urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101' version '2023-04-26')

# partition is a known IEEE 11073-10101 concept - discussion on Zulip how to fix this...
The property 'partition' is not known for the system 'urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101', so may not be understood by the terminology ecosystem. Known properties for this system: concept,code,status,inactive,effectiveDate,deprecationDate,retirementDate,notSelectable,synonym,comment,itemWeight

# The ISO/IEEE 11073 Codesystem is not draft - fixed by Grahame, but needs time before this warning goes away...

# These code systems are PHD specific
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# Slicing checks are too ambitious: when optional slices are present in a profile and a base profile this warning is generated.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/bp|4.0.1 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/oxygensat|4.0.1 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# Local reference swithin a bundle are not properly checked.

# The check on category code is too strict when multiple categories are used.
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Observation Category Codes' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-category|4.0.1), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/CodeSystem/PhdObservationCategories#phd-observation)
