# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem (And include comments like this justifying why)

# this rule makes no sense for device generated observations; all example observation in this IG are device generated; unless we consider the patient as the performer as well.
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# Supplemental information components have a valueCodeableConcept and even when present in vital signs observations they should not be required to have a UCUM unit code
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Vital Signs Units' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/ucum-vitals-common|4.0.1), and a coding from this value set is required) (codes = urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101#150588)

# this is a recent code for a spirometer device type
The code '528413' is not valid in the system urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101 (Unknown code '528413' in the CodeSystem 'urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101' version '2023-04-26')

# partition is a known IEEE 11073-10101 concept
The property 'partition' is not known for the system 'urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101', so may not be understood by the terminology ecosystem. Known properties for this system: concept,code,status,inactive,effectiveDate,deprecationDate,retirementDate,notSelectable,synonym,comment,itemWeight

# bits coding system issues
This property has only a code ('type') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem
This property has only a code ('source') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem

# The ISO/IEEE 11073 Codesystem is not draft

# too large code system
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed

# the PHD Base Observation is never instantiated directly on its own - it provides a basis for specific Observation profiles
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdBaseObservation'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

# When this happens, we'll handle it with THO... however ignores does not really work...
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# slicing checks are too ambitious
