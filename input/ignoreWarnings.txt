# Work-around for a bug introduced by the latest version of the publisher 1.1.63. The element <fixedUri> causes the error. Changing it to <fixeduri> fixes the error. HOWEVER, the error is only reported when the element is in an extension. When I have <fixedUri> in #any other element (and I do have it in many) no error is reported. I am assuming the <fixedUri> version is correct as it has never caused a problem before.
