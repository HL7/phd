# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem (And include comments like this justifying why)

# this rule makes no sense for device generated observations; all example observation in this IG are device generated
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# Supplemental information components have a valueCodeableConcept and even when present in vital signs observations they should not be required to have a UCUM unit code
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Vital Signs Units' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/ucum-vitals-common|4.0.1), and a coding from this value set is required) (codes = urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101#150588)

# this is a recent code for a spirometer device type
The code '528413' is not valid in the system urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101
