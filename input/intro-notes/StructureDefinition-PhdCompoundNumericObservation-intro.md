The Compound Numeric Observation Profile can be used when the PHD metric measurement is a vector or a set of related numeric concepts. Examples would be the x, y, and z components of the acceleration, the systolic, diastolic, and mean components of a blood pressure measurement, or the set of package positions and associated questions in the Advanced Medication Monitor. 

IEEE 11073-10206 ACOM supports more generic compounds where the components can be numeric, codeable concepts, sample arrays or strings. This profile is kept for backwards compatibility with older IEEE 11073-20601-based implementations.
