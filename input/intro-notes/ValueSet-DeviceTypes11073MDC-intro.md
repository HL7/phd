ValueSet for the ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 Nomenclatures Describing Device specialization types such as blood pressure, pulse oximeter, thermometer, ECG, etc.. This value set will grow as new specializations are defined.

Most of the codes included in this value set are from partition 'infra' which has value 8. 

The display value consists of the nomenclature code's reference identifier. Devices exchange the numerical codes as defined in the IEEE 11073-10101 standard, not reference identifiers, but the reference identifiers are often used where human readability are more important than efficiency or bandwidth. However, only the numerical codes are guaranteed to be unique.
