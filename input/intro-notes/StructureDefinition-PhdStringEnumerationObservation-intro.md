The PHD String Observation Profile is used when the PHD observation reports a human readable string. These types of observations have the disadvantage of being unprocessable by machine without out-of-band information. Codes are often used instead where the end user can display them appropriately based upon locale. As an example, it is used in the Cardiovascular device specialization to report the name of an exercise program option.

This profile is used to map ACOM and GHS String Observations. The ACOM/GHS string value is mapped to the Observation.valueString data element.
