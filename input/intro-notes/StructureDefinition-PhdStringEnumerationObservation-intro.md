The PHD String Observation Profile is used when the PHD observation reports a human readable string. As an example, it is used in the Cardiovascular device specialization to report the name of an exercise program option. These types of observations have the disadvantage of being language dependent. Codes are often used instead where the end user can display them appropriately based upon locale.

This profile is used to map ACOM and GHS String Observations. The ACOM/GHS string value is mapped to the `Observation.valueString` data element.
