A Patient resource adhering to the PHD Patient Profile is used as a reference for most Observations. Dependent on the use case, the Patient resource may contain only minimal information sufficient to identify the patient resource on the server. It is also possible that the Patient resource is never uploaded by the PHG. In that case, the logical id to a Patient resource on the FHIR server must be provided to the PHG by some other means.

The PHD Patient Profile may or may not include patient-identifiable information, depending on the use case. For example, in Remote Patient Monitoring, PII/PHI protection may be critical, while in other cases, such as fitness tracking by a coach monitoring team performance. In such cases, protecting fitness data may not justify the associated effort and inconvenience. This profile supports both scenarios.

If a Patient resource is created by the PHG, only `Patient.identifier.system`, `Patient.identifier.value`, `Patient.identifier.type.coding.code`, and `Patient.identifier.type.coding.system` are required. The `Patient.name` element is optional, helping in PII/PHI protection since the required fields cannot be linked to a person without a dictionary that should only be available to the healthcare provider.
