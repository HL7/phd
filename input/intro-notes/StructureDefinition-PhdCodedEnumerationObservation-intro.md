The Coded Enumeration Observation Profile is used when the PHD metric measurement is represented by one of a limited set of codes. This corresponds to the Single Event Observation class in IEEE 11073-10206 ACOM and the Simple Discrete Observation in GHS.  

The MDC code of the value in this observation resource corresponds to the value element in these ACOM and GHS observation classes.

One example of a coded measurement would be the Glucose Monitor meal context associated with a glucose concentration measurement. The code would indicate one of fasting, preprandial, postprandial, bedtime, etc. Coded measurements are often associated with other measurements. Another example would be the type of exercise in an activity session (walk, run, swim, hike, bike, etc.). Each of these enumerated options is given by a nomenclature code.
