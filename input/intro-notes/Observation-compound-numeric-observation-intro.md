This example shows a compound (numeric) observation. The most common type of compound observation is the Blood Pressure. The systolic, diastolic, and mean values are treated as parts of the same observation. The compound elements are reported in Observation.component elements and that there is **no** value[x] in the 'primary' observation. In addition, that the 'mean' component is not considered as one of FHIR's vital signs and no LOINC code is present for that component code.

Note that the referenced resources - Patient, PHG, PHD, and coincident timestamp - are assumed to be present on the server already.
