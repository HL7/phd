Value set for those Observation component elements that come from compound and BITs measurements. These attributes come from several partitions but NOT the MDC Object partition. These codes are used as slicing discriminators to distinguish between those components that represent measurement values in the compound and ASN1 BITs profiles from those components providing additional information about the values. For example, the Supplemental Information would give an extra description about the measurement such as 'duration average' whereas the measurement itself might be acceleration values.
