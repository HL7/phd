This example shows a coded enumeration Observation. Coded enumerations are used when the measurement itself is a code. In this case, the measurement is the meal context associated with a glucose measurement. There is a limited set of possible entries for this measurement, this one indicating after lunch or dinner. In the future, this measurement will contain a source-handle reference pointing to the measurement containing the glucose concentration. For now, the associated Observation has to be determined by time stamp and the PHD and patient references.
