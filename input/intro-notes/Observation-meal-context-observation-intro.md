This example shows a coded enumeration Observation. Coded enumerations are used when the measurement itself is a code. In this case, the measurement is the meal context associated with a glucose measurement. There is a limited set of possible entries for this measurement, this one indicating after lunch or dinner. This measurement should contain a derived-from reference pointing to the measurement containing the glucose concentration. When this is absent, the associated Observation can only be determined by using the timestamp and the PHD and patient references.
