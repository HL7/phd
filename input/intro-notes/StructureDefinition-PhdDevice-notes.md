### System Identifier
All IEEE 11073-20601 PHDs are required to have a system identifier. It is an EUI-64 consisting of 8 bytes. The system id is mapped to the Device.identifier.value element as a sequence of 8 2-digit bytes as HEX separated by dashes without the '0x' prefix commonly used in programming languages. An example of such a string is FE-ED-AB-EE-DE-AD-77-C3. Though required for Continua compliance, it is not required in the Bluetooth Low Energy health device specifications. When a PHG encounters such a device it shall enter 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00 and it is highly recommended to provide a transport address as a means of uniquely identifying the PHD.

In order to discriminate between an identifier that is a system id and that which is a transport address the identifier.type element is used. A Continua-defined CodeSystem [Device Identifier Codes](CodeSystem-ContinuaDeviceIdentifiers.html) has the codes one can use to populate the identifier.type.coding.code element.

The transport addresses are as follows:

<style>table, th, td {
border: 1px solid black;
border-collapse:collapse;
padding: 6px;}</style>

|transport|format|example|
|-
|Bluetooth|EUI-48|00-E5-DE-AD-77-C3|
|ZigBee|EUI-64|36-ED-9A-EE-DE-AD-77-C3|
|USB|vid.pid|0043.F90D|

The identifier is encoded as follows:

|Source|Device Encoding|
|-
|System-Id.value|identifier.value=*formatted as above*<br>identifier.system="urn:oid:1.2.840.10004.1.1.1.0.0.1.0.0.1.2680"<br>identifier.type.coding.system="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/CodeSystem/ContinuaDeviceIdentifiers"<br>identifier.type.coding.code="SYSID"|

### Device.udiCarrier ###
The UDI has recently been introduced into the IEEE 11073-20601 standard, however, no PHDs have implemented this feature and it is not yet present in Bluetooth Low Energy. For that reason, the mapping of this element is not specified in this version of the implementation guide. The IEEE 11073-20601 standard supports an issuer, jurisdiction, and the Human Readable interpretation of the barcode. The udiCarrier does have elements for each of these entries. On the other hand, there is no appropriate entryType code for this sourcing of the UDI as it is obtained electronically through protocol.

It is anticipated that all these issues will be resolved and that eventually PHDs will support it via protocol. At that time a mapping from the IEEE UDI to the Device.uidCarrier will be specified.

### Device.type ###
The Device type is the same for all PHDs and it indicates that the device is a PHD. The details of what the PHD does is found in the Device.specializations element. The MDC code being used is 65573 (reference id MDC_MOC_VMS_MDS_SIMP). In 11073-10201 this code is described as indicating "a single-purpose medical device". The code is also used in 11073-20601 to identify the MDS object, but there is no particular description as to its interpretation.

The Device.type shall be encoded as follows:

 - Device.type.coding.code="65573"
 - Device.type.coding.system="urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"
 - Device.type.display="MDC_MOC_VMS_MDS_SIMP"

The display element is optional but is recommended.

### System Type Spec List
The System-Type-Spec-List attribute contains a list of specializations the PHD complies to. The elements in the list indicate not only what the PHD does, but that it does so in a manner specified in the specialization documents.  Each element in the list contains the specialization and its version. In most cases there is just one entry in the list.

For each entry in the System-Type-Spec-List a specializations entry is encoded as follows: 

|System-Type-Spec-List entry|Device encoding|
|- 
|System-Type-Spec-List.type|specialization.systemType.coding.code="code"<br>specialization.systemType.coding.system="urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"<br>specialization.systemType.text="*reference-id plus additional text*" |
|System-Type-Spec-List.version|specialization.version="version" |

where "code" is the 32-bit nomenclature code computed from the partition INFRA and the term code from System-Type-Spec-List.type and "version" is the version from System-Type-Spec-List.version.

The display element is optional but it is highly recommended that it be included and the reference id be in the description. The table below gives a list of some of the most common specializations and their codes:

|Specialization|MDC Code partition:term code|Reference Identifier|
|-
|Generic 20601 Device|8::4169|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_GENERIC|
|Pulse Oximeter|8::4100|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_PULS_OXIM|
|Electro cardiograph|8::4102|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_MIN_ECG|

|Coagulation meter |8::4114|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_COAG|
|Insulin Pump|8::4115|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_INSULIN_PUMP|
|Body Composition Analyzer|8::4116|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_BCA|
|Peak Flow meter|8::4117|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_PEAK_FLOW|
|Sleep Apnea Breathing Equipment|8::4120| MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_SABTE|
|Continuous Glucose Monitor|8::4121|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_CGM|
|Cardiovascular Device|8::4137|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_HF_CARDIO|
|Strength Equipment|8::4138|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_HF_STRENGTH|
|Independent Activity/Living Hub|8::4167|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_AI_ACTIVITY_HUB|
|Medication Monitor|8::4168|MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_AI_MED_MINDER|

The 'generic' device on the PHD side indicates that the device follows 20601 but not any specialization. On the PHG side it indicates that the PHG understands anything following the 20601 standard. That would include all specializations since all specializations are a subset of the 20601 standard.

The table below gives the set of 32-bit MDC codes and reference identifiers used in the subsequent mappings.

### System Model
The System-Model attribute contains two strings, the manufacturer name and the model number. The Device resource has stand-alone primitive elements for these two fields. The mapping is straight forward:

|System-Model|Device encoding|
|- 
|System-Model.manufacturer|manufacturer="System-Model.manufacturer" |
|System-Model.model-number|modelNumber="System-Model.model-number" |

### Production-Specification ###
The Production-Specification attribute values are mapped to three separate elements in the Device, the Device.serialNumber, Device.partNumber, and Device.version. The serialNumber and partNumber elements are string primitives, thus it is not possible to map the PrivateOid of those two values without extensions. The version element, on the other hand, is a Backbone element which will allow such a mapping without the use of extensions.

The mapping is as follows:

|Production-Specification entry|Device encoding|
|- 
|Production-Specification.spec-type = 1 (*serial number*)<br>Production-Specification.value|serialNumber="Production-Specification.value" |
|Production-Specification.spec-type = 2 (*part number*)<br>Production-Specification.value|partNumber="Production-Specification.value" |
|Production-Specification.spec-type = 3 (*hardware version*)<br>Production-Specification.PrivateOid<br>Production-Specification.value|version.type.coding.code="531974"<br>version.type.coding.system="urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"<br>version.type.text="MDC_ID_PROD_SPEC_HW + optional text"\*\*<br>version.value="Production-Specification.value"<br>version.component.system="system id formatted as above"\*<br> version.component.value="Production-Specification.PrivateOid"\*|
|Production-Specification.spec-type = 4 (*software version*)<br>Production-Specification.PrivateOid<br>Production-Specification.value|version.type.coding.code="531975"<br>version.type.coding.system="urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"<br>version.type.text="MDC_ID_PROD_SPEC_SW + optional text"\*\*<br>version.value="Production-Specification.value"<br>version.component.system="system id formatted as above"\*<br> version.component.value="Production-Specification.PrivateOid"\*|
|Production-Specification.spec-type = 5 (*firmware version*)<br>Production-Specification.PrivateOid<br>Production-Specification.value|version.type.coding.code="531976"<br>version.type.coding.system="urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"<br>version.type.text="MDC_ID_PROD_SPEC_FW + optional text"\*\*<br>version.value="Production-Specification.value"<br>version.component.system="system id formatted as above"\*<br> version.component.value="Production-Specification.PrivateOid"\*|
|Production-Specification.spec-type = 6 (*protocol version*)<br>Production-Specification.PrivateOid<br>Production-Specification.value|version.type.coding.code="531977"<br>version.type.coding.system="urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"<br>version.type.text="MDC_ID_PROD_SPEC_PROTOCOL + optional text"\*\*<br>version.value="Production-Specification.value"<br>version.component.system="system id formatted as above"\*<br> version.component.value="Production-Specification.PrivateOid"\*|

*The PrivateOid is only a 16-bit unsigned number. To give it some meaning, the system-id of the device is placed in the Identifier 'system' value to link the PrivateOid to this physical device in the presence of some other possible identifiers.

**The text elements are optional but it is encouraged to include them and populate them with at least the reference identifier.

### Reg-Cert-Data-List ###
The Reg-Cert-Data-List contains the Continua version, list of certified PHD interfaces, and the regulation status. The Continua version is mapped to an additional Device.version element and the other two fields are mapped to a Device.property element.

#### Reg-Cert-Data-List Continua version

The Continua version has a major and minor component which are 8-bit unsigned integers. The code reported in the Device.versions element is obtained by concatenating the major-version, a dot (.), and the minor version. For example, "6.1" where "6" is the major version and "1" is the minor version. 

The Continua version code is mapped to a Device.version element.

#### Reg-Cert-Data-List Continua Certified PHD interfaces
The Reg-Cert-Data-List attribute reports the list of Continua *certified* PHD (Personal Area Network) interfaces as a list of Continua-specified PHD interface codes. Note there is a difference between certified PHD interfaces and supported PHD interfaces. The Continua-specified certification codes obtained from the Reg-Cert-Data-List are a combination of a transport code and a device specialization code. See [the PHD Interface codes](CodeSystem-ContinuaPHDCS.html) for the list of possible codes.

The PHD interface codes are mapped to a list of properties where the property.valueCode element carries a single PHD interface code. The property.type element, which identifies the property, is given by the MDC code `532353`. Its reference id is `MDC_REG_CERT_DATA_CONTINUA_CERT_DEV_LIST`. 

#### Reg-Cert-Data-List Regulation Status
The regulation status element is a 16-bit ASN1 BITs 'state' value (see [ASN1 To HL7 Codesystem](CodeSystem-ASN1ToHL7.html)). At the current time only Mder bit 0 is defined. Being a state value, both set and cleared states are reported. In fact, it is the cleared state which represents that the device is regulated. 

The regulation status is mapped to an additional Device.property.valueCode element. The Device.property.type element, which identifies the property, is given by 532354.0 following the ASN1 BITs mapping where the code 532354 is the MDC code for the regulation status. Its reference identifier is MDC_REG_CERT_DATA_CONTINUA_REG_STATUS. The '0' appended to the regulation status code indicates Mder bit 0. The Device.property.valueCode will indicate either "Y" (set) or "N" (cleared).

The following table summarizes the mapping of the Reg-Cert-Data-List information to FHIR:


|Reg-Cert-Data-List|Device Mapping|
|-
|Reg-Cert-Data-List: continuaVersion|version.type.coding.code="532352"<br>version.type.coding.system="urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"<br>version.type.text="MDC_REG_CERT_DATA_CONTINUA_VERSION + text"<br>version.value="Continua version code"<br><br>|

|Reg-Cert-Data-List: regulation status|property.type.coding.code="532354.0"<br>property.type.coding.system="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/CodeSystem/ASN1ToHL7"<br>property.type.display="negated-regulation-status"<br>property.valueBoolean="true=unregulated false=regulated"|

Text elements are recommended but optional.

### Mds-Time-Info
The Mds-Time-Info attribute is required on PHDs that support a real time clock of some type and report timestamps in their measurements. In Bluetooth Low Energy devices these properties must be inferred from other information like the Current Time Service. If the PHD does NOT report a timestamp in any of its measurements, there is no need to report the static time information ***EXCEPT*** that there is no time synchronization.

#### Time Capabilities
The Mds-Time-Info attribute has a 16-bit ASN1 BITs field for the time capabilities. They are mapped as follows:

|Mder Bit position	|IEEE.ASN1 Code	|ASN.1 name|static|Device.|
|-
|0  |68219.0	|mds-time-capab-real-time-clock|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.0"|
|1	|68219.1	|mds-time-capab-set-clock|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.1"|
|2	|68219.2	|mds-time-capab-relative-time|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.2"|
|3	|68219.3	|mds-time-capab-high-res-relative-time|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.3"|
|4	|68219.4	|mds-time-capab-sync-abs-time|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.4"|
|5	|68219.5	|mds-time-capab-sync-rel-time|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.5"|
|6	|68219.6	|mds-time-capab-sync-hi-res-relative-time|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.6"|
|7	|68219.7	|mds-time-capab-bo-time|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.7"|
|8	|68219.8	|mds-time-state-abs-time-synced|no||
|9	|68219.9	|mds-time-state-rel-time-synced|no||
|10	|68219.10	|mds-time-state-hi-res-relative-time-synced|no||
|11	|68219.11	|mds-time-mgr-set-time|no||
|12	|68219.12	|mds-time-capab-sync-bo-time|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.12"|
|13	|68219.13	|mds-time-state-bo-time-synced|no||
|14	|68219.14	|mds-time-state-bo-time-UTC-aligned|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.14"|
|15	|68219.15	|mds-time-dst-rules-enabled|yes|property.type.coding.code="68219.15"|

The required remaining property elements in each reported case are as follows:
 - property.type.coding.system="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/CodeSystem/ASN1ToHL7"
 - property.valueBoolean ="true" or "false" depending on the state of the Mder bit

Only the static fields shall be reported and all the static fields are treated as events thus they only need to be reported if set. Reporting cleared static states is optional.

#### Time Synchronization
The Mds-Time-Info.*time-sync-protocol* indicates the method of time synchronization which has one of the term code values in the following table:

|32-bit code|Reference identifier|	description	|partition:term code|
|-
|532224	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_NONE	|An uncalibrated and unsynchronized local clock source	|8::7936|
|532234	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_EBWW	|A manually set time, by ‘eyeball and wristwatch’	|8::7946|
|532225	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_NTPV3	|Network Time Protocol Version 3.0 (RFC 1305)	|8::7937|
|532226	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_NTPV4	|Network Time Protocol Version 4.0 (under dev)	|8::7938|
|532227	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_SNTPV4	|Simple Network Time Protocol v4 (RFC 2030)	|8::7939|
|532228	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_SNTPV4330	|Simple Network Time Protocol v4 (RFC 4330)	|8::7940|
|532229	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_BTV1	|Bluetooth Medical Device Profile	|8::7941|
|532235	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_USB_SOF	|Synced to the 1kHz USB "start-of-frame" clock|8::7947|
|532230	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_RADIO	|Atomic Clock synchronization through RF	|8::7942|
|532231	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_HL7_NCK	|Synchronized via Health Level 7 NCK (network clock)|8::7943|
|532232	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_CDMA	CDMA |mobile telecommunications synchronization	|8::7944|
|532233	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_GSM	|GSM - Network Identity and Time Zone (NITZ)	|8::7945|
|532236	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_OTHER	|A time sync method that is out of scope for IEEE 11073	|8::7948|
|532237	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_OTHER_MOBILE	|A time sync method based on other mobile network technology that is not listed above	|8::7949|
|532238	|MDC_TIME_SYNC_GPS	|A time sync method based on GPS information	|8::7950|

If the Mds-Time-Info.*time-sync-protocol* indicates some other value besides 7936 (no time synchronization) the uploader must look at the time capabilities bits 8, 9, 10, or 13 to see if the PHD actually *is* synchronized. If the time capabilities bits indicate that the PHD is synchronized, then the time synchronization method in Mds-Time-Info.*time-sync-protocol* is reported in the Device.property element. Otherwise the uploader reports that the PHD is unsynchronized.

The uploader maps the state of synchronization to the Device.property as follows:

 - Device.property.type.coding.code="68220"
 - Device.property.type.coding.system="urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"
 - Device.property.type.text="MDC_TIME_SYNC_PROTOCOL" *(optional)*
 - Device.property.valueCode.coding.code="*32-bit code for sync method*"
 - Device.property.valueCode.coding.system="urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"
 - Device.property.valueCode.text="*the ref id*"  *(optional)*

To date there are no PHDs that support an external time synchronization. However, many PHDs have the PHG set its time and PHGs are required to support an external time synchronization. The IEEE PHD WG is working on providing some means to indicate synchronization by the PHG. In lieu of that, a consumer can only infer that the PHG probably set the time on the PHG if 
 - the PHD indicates that set time is supported
 - the current time clock differences between the PHG and PHD are about 0.

#### Time Synchronization Accuracy
The time synchronization accuracy is given by the Mds-Time-Info.*time-sync-accuracy* field. *This value shall not be reported if the PHD reports a value of 0xFFFFFFFF which indicates unknown.* Otherwise the value reported is in units of 1/8<sup>th</sup> millisecond. When reported in the Device.property element it is scaled to microseconds. The mapping is as follows:
 - Device.property.type.coding.code="68221"
 - Device.property.type.coding.system="urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"
 - Device.property.type.text="MDC_TIME_SYNC_ACCURACY" *(optional)*
 - Device.property.valueQuantity.value="125 x Mds-Time-Info.*time-sync-accuracy*"
 - Device.property.valueQuantity.system="http://unitsofmeasure.org"
 - Device.property.valueQuantity.code="us"  (UCUM code for microseconds)

#### Time Resolution
The Mds-Time-Info attribute has three fields that report the resolution of its time clocks. 

The Mds-Time-Info.time-resolution-abs-time represents the resolution of the absolute-time clock when the sensor supports an absolute time clock. If the sensor supports a base-offset time clock it represents the resolution of the base-offset time clock. The sensor is not allowed to support both time clocks simultaneously during an association. Which time clock is supported is indicated by the settings of the Mder 0 and 7 bits of the time capabilities (Mds-Time-Info.mds-time-caps-state).

The sensor may additionally support both relative time clocks or just one or both of the relative time clocks without any ‘wall time’ clock. In practice, support of more than one real time clock at the same time is rare.

*If the respective time resolution has a value of 0, it indicates that the resolution is unknown and it shall not be reported.* In all other cases, the resolutions are reported.

All time resolution values shall be scaled to units of microseconds. When supporting absolute time, the Mds-Time-Info.time-resolution-abs-time is in units of 1/100th of a second. When supporting base-offset time, the Mds-Time-Info.time-resolution-abs-time is in units of 1/65536th of a second. In the base-offset case, the special value of 0xFFFF means one second. The Mds-Time-Info.time-resolution-rel-time is in units of 1/8th millisecond and the Mds-Time-Info.time-resolution-hi-res-relative-time is in units of microseconds.

Though not a part of the MdsTimeInfo attribute the Tick resolution attribute used for RR-intervals in the ECG specialization is also encoded as a property in this group. However its units are in cycles per second, such that a value as 1024 indicates 1024 cycles per second.

|Device.property element|value|
|-
|Device.property.type.coding.code|"68229" (Tick Resolution)|
|Device.property.type.coding.system|"urn.iso.std.iso:11073:10101"|

|Device.property.valueQuantity.value|Tick-Resolution.*value*|
|Device.property.valueQuantity.system|"http://unitsofmeasure.org" |
|Device.property.valueQuantity.code|"Hz"  (UCUM code for Hertz)|

The encoding for the resolution values is as follows:

|Device.property element|value|
|-
|Device.property.type.coding.code|"68222" (absolute time)<br/>"68226" (base-offset time)<br/>"68223" (relative time)<br/>"68224" (hi-res relative time)|
