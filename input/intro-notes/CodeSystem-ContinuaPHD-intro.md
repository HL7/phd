These codes are used to express the Continua Personal Area Network (PHD) interfaces. The codes express both the transport (Bluetooth, USB, etc.) and the device specialization (Blood pressure, thermometer, glucose, etc.).

The codes are generated by the following formula:

```
PHD interface code = transport code * 8192 + (device specialization code - 4096)
```
The transport code has the following values:

|Transport Code|Transport|
|--|--|
|0|Continua version 1.0|
|1|USB|
|2|Bluetooth HDP|
|3|ZigBee|
|4|Bluetooth Low Energy|
|5|NFC|

The transport code of 0 is for Continua version 1.0 when there was no transport component in the reported certified PHD interface codes.
