* unit
  * ^comment = "When the type of the observation is numeric or compound numeric, the unit could be filled in as well. This should be a UCUM code, but when that is not known, it can be an MDC code. This field can be updated by the gateway when an observation of the corresponding type is generated by the PHD."
* operationalStatus
  * ^comment = "For a PHD device the operational status is only known when it is communicating. It is recommended to leave this field out."
* category
  * ^comment = "When the category can be derived from the type of the DeviceMetric it can be filled in on creation. Otherwise it can be filled in by updating the DeviceMetric resource when the PHD generates an observation of that type. It can be set to #unspecified until known."
