  * ^comment = "The RTSA metric is typically used for reporting waveform type data such as an ECG trace, spirometer exhalation rates, pulse oximetry pleth waves, etc., though it can be used to report any set of numric measurements that are periodic. The periodicity is important as the timestamps of each individual entry is known from the start time and the period. Since the amount of data to be transmitted can be large, the data is scaled in such a way to minimize the number of bits taken up by each entry (though the minimization is restricted to 8, 16, or 32 bits). This scaling information is sent along with the start time and period in order for the receiver to recover the original data and to obtain the timestamp of each data point. In theory, this data could be sent using countless phdNumericObservation type resources at a great cost in bandwidth!"

    * ^comment = "The data sent in the Sa-Simple-Observation-Value array is also scaled. Thus with the proper setting of the valueSampledData.origin.value and valueSampledData.factor, the data from the IEEE device can be placed into the data[i] array without modification."
