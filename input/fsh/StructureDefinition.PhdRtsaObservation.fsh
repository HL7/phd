The periodicity is important as the time stamps of each individual entry is known from the start time and the period. Since the amount of data to be transmitted can be large, the data is scaled in such a way to minimize the number of bits taken up by each entry (though the minimization is restricted to 8, 16, or 32 bits). This scaling information is sent along with the start time and period in order for the receiver to recover the original data and to obtain the time stamp of each data point. In theory, this data could be sent using countless phdNumericObservation type resources at a great cost in bandwidth!"
